# Note:  Directives and their values are case-sensitive.
#

# For clients, specify the IP address or host of the server that
# you're connecting to:
#
#    Client <ip-address-or-hostname>
#
# (Use either the "Client" or "Server" directive to configure
# HANS accordingly.)
#
Client hans-server.example.com

# For servers, specify the IP address of the internal /24
# network to use (this network will be extended to clients, who
# will each be assigned an IP address automatically via DHCP):
#
#    Server <ip-address-or-hostname>
#
# (Use either the "Client" or "Server" directive to configure
# HANS accordingly.)
#
#Server 10.4.0.1

# Using a passphrase is essential as a means to preventing
# unauthorized clients from connecting and accessing your
# network (you should also limit which clients can connect to
# your server by using firewall rules to block all except for
# those public IP addresses that your users are known to
# connect from).
#
#    Passphrase <password>
#
Passphrase radio-active_cats_have_18_half-lives

# Make HANS run under the specified user (downgrade from root).
#
#    Username <username>
#
#Username nobody

# Request a specific IP address be assigned by the HANS' DHCP
# server.
#
#    RequestIP <ip-address>
#
#RequestIP 10.4.0.42

# Respond to ordinary ICMP ping requests in server mode.
#
#    RespondToPing < Yes | On | 1 | No | Off | 0 >
#

# Specify which network interface device to use.
#
#    Device <tun-device-name>
#
#Device tun0

# Set the maximum size of echo packets.
#
# Default:  1500
#
#    MTU <integer>
#
#MTU 1500

# Number of echo requests clients send in advance for the server
# to reply to.  0 disabled polling, which is believed to be the
# best choice in networks that allow unlimited echo replies.
#
# Default:  10

#    MaxPolls <integer>
#
#MaxPolls 10

# Change ICMP echo ID on every request.  While this may help
# with buggy network routers, performance may be impacted.

# Change the ICMP packet Sequence number on every ICMP echo
# request.  While this may help with buggy network routers,
# performance may be impacted.
